# Event_Volunteer_Matcher
My Project Event–Volunteer Matcher,is a smart solution for managing college events and assigning the right volunteers.

In colleges, multiple events happen throughout the year — technical fests, cultural events, workshops, and competitions.
The biggest challenge coordinators face is:
 -Selecting suitable volunteers manually
 -Matching volunteers’ skills with event requirements
 -Maintaining volunteer records

so we have built a project or a  system that compares event required skills with volunteer skills, interests, and experience, then gives the best-fit volunteers.

This project:
 -Reduces manual work
 -Makes volunteer assignment fair and efficient
 -Saves time
 -Gives coordinators clean, data-driven choices
 -Scales easily for any college event system

now I will demonstrate the projectHere is the Volunteers Management Page.
 What it does:
  -Allows coordinators to add new volunteers
  -Stores volunteer details like name, branch, year, interests, skills, and experience
  -Fetches stored volunteers from the backend and displays them in a tab

Now this is the Events Management Page.
Here I can enter event details like:
 -Event name
 -Required skills
 -Volunteers needed
 -Event date

 Match Volunteer:
  -Event ke required skills ko padhta hai
  -Volunteers ke skills, interests & experience check karta hai
  -Skill match hone par score deta hai
  -Experience aur interests bhi score increase karte hain
